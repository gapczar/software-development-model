Software Development Model Proposal - 0
=======================================

## Motivation

#### Ambiguous project requirements

*    There is no criteria for a clear, meaningful, and useful requirement
*    There is no process to obtain, clarify, and analyze a requirement
*    Inability to clarify requirements lead to volatile features
*    Scope and goal of project is not established
  
#### No project development documentation
*    Knowledge of a project is limited to a few individuals
*    Recieving end in a project handover is in deep shit
*    An individual leaving a project creates a significant knowledge void
*    Experience gained is not effectively utilized for succeeding projects e.g:
    *    Projecting an accurate timeline for projects/tasks
    *    Identifying recurring development obstacles
    *    Reusing solutions

#### Lack of clear development process
*    Inability of developers to clearly see the bigger picture:
    *    What features relevant to the client have been completed?
    *    Which features should be developed first?
    *    At what stage is the development in?
*    Non-technical individuals involved are in the dark on the project's progress
    *    These non-technical individuals are usually the managers

#### Structure lacks purpose
*    Structure serves only to organize individuals
*    Structure has no well-defined development process to facilitate

## Goals

1.    Establish criteria to be met by requirements gathering and analysis
2.    Promote project documentation
3.    Facilitate retention of knowledge on projects
4.    Facilitate utilization of experience gained in past projects
5.    Identify and emphasize the business value of features being developed
6.    Facilitate presentation and understanding of the development process

## Model
The development process has 2 main divisions:

*    High Level Development (**HiLD**)
*    Low Level Development (**LoLD**)


### High Level Development (**HiLD**)

HiLD proceeds as follows:

1.    Project Analysis
2.    Incremental Low Level Development (LoLD)
3.    Post Mortem

#### I. Project Analysis
Project Analysis focuses on the project as a whole and must be aimed at identifying the project's main purpose and features.


The very first step in a project is identifying and stating its **mission**. The **mission** should state what end the project must to achieve.


### Low Level Development (**LoLD**)

1.    Analysis
2.    Design  
3.    Implementation  
4.    Testing
5.    Deployment
