Software Development Model Proposal - 0
=======================================

## Motivation

#### Ambiguous requirements

*    There is no criteria for a clear, meaningful, and useful requirement
*    There is no process to obtain, clarify, and analyze a requirement
*    Inability to clarify requirements lead to volatile features
*    Scope and goal of project is not established

#### Lack of clear development process
*    Inability of developers to clearly see the bigger picture:
    *    What features are relevant to the client?
    *    Which features should be developed first?
    *    At what stage is the development in?
*    Non-technical individuals involved are in the dark on the project's progress
    *    These non-technical individuals are usually the managers

#### Structure lacks purpose
*    Structure serves only to organize individuals
*    Structure has no well-defined development process to facilitate

#### No project development documentation
*    Knowledge of a project is limited to a few individuals
*    Receiving end in a project handover is in deep shit
*    An individual leaving a project creates a significant knowledge void
*    Experience gained is not effectively utilized for succeeding projects e.g:
    *    Projecting an accurate timeline for projects/tasks
    *    Identifying recurring development obstacles
    *    Reusing solutions

## Purpose

This software development model aims to provide an infrastructure for managers, developers, and clients to effectively and efficiently collaborate in a software development project.

## Proposed Model



The development process has 2 main divisions:

*    High Level Development (**HiLD**)
*    Low Level Development (**LoLD**)


### High Level Development (HiLD)

HiLD proceeds as follows:

1.    Project Analysis
2.    Incremental Low Level Development (LoLD)
3.    Post Mortem

#### I. Project Analysis
Project Analysis focuses on the project as a whole and must be aimed at identifying the project's main purpose and features.


The very first step in a project is identifying and stating its **mission**. The **mission** should state what end the project must to achieve.


### Low Level Development (LoLD)

1.    Analysis
2.    Design  
3.    Implementation  
4.    Testing
5.    Deployment
