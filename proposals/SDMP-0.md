Software Development Model Proposal - 0
=======================================
## Motivation

#### Ambiguous requirements

* There is no criteria for a clear, meaningful, and useful requirement
* There is no process to obtain, clarify, and analyze a requirement
* Inability to clarify requirements lead to volatile features
* Scope and goal of project is not established

#### Lack of clear development process
* Inability of developers to clearly see the bigger picture:
    *    What features are relevant to the client?
    *    Which features should be developed first?
    *    At what stage is the development in?
* Non-technical individuals involved are (more or less) in the dark on the project's progress
    *    These non-technical individuals are usually managers


## Purpose
This software development model aims to provide an infrastructure for managers, developers, and clients to effectively collaborate in a software development project.


## Proposed Model
This model has 2 prominent stages:

1. **Stage 1**
2. **Stage 2**


### Stage 1
This is the envisioning stage or ***iteration-0*** of a typical Agile software development approach.

In this stage, the following information about the project must be obtained:

* **Motivation** (or Business Need)
* **Purpose**
    * Features must contribute to the realization of the purpose
    * Features must be in line with the purpose
* **Queue of Initial Features**


### Stage 2
This is the iterative development stage which will cycle while the queue of features is not empty. An iteration will typically have the following stages:

1. **Prioritization** - Identify the most important unimplemented feature
2. **Development** - Design, code, and test the feature (Check out XP)
3. **Retrospective** - Evaluate how the iteration went then adapt (Re-evaluate process, timeline, features, mindset, etc.)

Lather. Rinse. Repeat.


### Conclusion
[TODO]
