Software Development Model Proposal - 0
=======================================

## Purpose

This software development model aims to provide an infrastructure for managers, developers, and clients to effectively collaborate and organize a software development project.

## Proposed Model

As a guide post, the product is always the focus.

Taking inpiration from Agile software development, this model has 2 prominent stages:

1. **Product Analysis and Planning**
2. **Iterative Development**

### Product Analysis and Planning

This is considered the envisioning stage or ***iteration-0*** of a typical Agile software development approach.

The following information must be obtained in this stage:

* **Motivation** - Identify what motivation/business need is behind the product to be developed
* **Purpose** - Identify what end the product is supposed to achieve
* **Scope** - Identify the general features of the product
* **Queue of initial features** - Identify a set of specific features for the product

### Iterative Development

Iterative development stage will cycle while the feature queue is not empty and will generate working software at each iteration. An iteration will typically have the following stages:

1. **Prioritization** - Identify the most important unimplemented feature in queue
2. **Analysis** - Conduct an analysis of the feature; Is it specific enough?
3. **Development** - Design, code, and test the feature
4. **Retrospective** - Gather feedback about the iteration
5. **Adaptation** - Update requirements and/or re-evaluate approach if necessary

### Conclusion
The product development concludes when the feature queue is empty. The software development project consequently conclude when the product is complete.
