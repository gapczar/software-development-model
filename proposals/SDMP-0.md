Software Development Model Proposal - 0
=======================================

## Purpose

This software development model aims to provide an infrastructure for managers, developers, and clients to effectively and efficiently collaborate in a software development project.

## Proposed Model







The development process has 2 main divisions:

*    High Level Development (**HiLD**)
*    Low Level Development (**LoLD**)


### High Level Development (HiLD)

HiLD proceeds as follows:

1.    Project Analysis
2.    Incremental Low Level Development (LoLD)
3.    Post Mortem

#### I. Project Analysis
Project Analysis focuses on the project as a whole and must be aimed at identifying the project's main purpose and features.


The very first step in a project is identifying and stating its **mission**. The **mission** should state what end the project must to achieve.


### Low Level Development (LoLD)

1.    Analysis
2.    Design  
3.    Implementation  
4.    Testing
5.    Deployment
